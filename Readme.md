project explanation:

fist i have divided the project into sub tasks.i take the flex container two arrange items in horizontal
after that i make an api call using fetch() method and get the json object as result.by using this data i can display the content on webpage using DOM Methods like textContent,src,style,classList,etc.i used addEventListener event to trigger the event whenever we clik on images,buttons.i used appendChild Dom method to append child element to the parent element.i used src attribute with img element to display images and i used setAttribute method to add attributes to the elements.createElement() Dom method is used to create new elements.that is all about my project.
